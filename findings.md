# Findings

## Research Notes
- Task map v3.0 shows TS-011 through TS-020 pending (except TS-016 deferred) after TS-010 complete.
- Critical path from TS-011 (Act III image loop) through TS-014 (viewer integration).
- Viewer upload flow supports local bundle via localStorage key: storysmith_final_bundle.

## Constraints
- Do not implement tools/ scripts until discovery answers and gemini.md schema are approved.
