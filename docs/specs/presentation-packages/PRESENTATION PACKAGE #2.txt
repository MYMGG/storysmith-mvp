PRESENTATION PACKAGE #2 — “RNG / Variation Engine” (Anti-Samey by Design)

Slide 1 — Title
- RNG / Variation Engine: structured uniqueness without breaking continuity
- Goal: stop “samey outputs” at scale while keeping quality premium
- Outcome: measurable diversity + user-controlled re-rolls

Slide 2 — The Problem (what’s happening today)
- With only a few user answers, output space is small → books feel like reskins
- “Randomness” alone causes incoherence or tone drift
- Variation is currently implicit and unmeasured → we can’t prove uniqueness
- Paid tier risk: users pay, then feel “I’ve seen this before”

Slide 3 — The Proposal (what we’re building)
- A first-class Variation Engine that produces “Variation Directives”
- Inputs:
  - IntentState (hero + preferences)
  - Seed (deterministic)
  - Knob profile (tone/stakes/pacing/etc.)
- Outputs:
  - Variation Directives (structured choices that guide outline, prose, prompts)
  - Traceable metadata for audits + replays + experimentation

Slide 4 — What “RNG” means here (definition)
- Not “random words”
- It is “controlled variety” across:
  - story structures
  - motifs and symbolism
  - supporting cast archetypes
  - twists and reveals
  - emotional pacing
  - humor intensity and style
  - visual prompt details (without breaking consistency)

Slide 5 — Variation Knobs (user + system)
- Knobs the system can vary safely:
  - Tone: warm / witty / epic / cozy / mysterious
  - Stakes: small personal / family / community / world-lite
  - Pacing: gentle / balanced / fast
  - Setting: realistic / magical-lite / fantastical
  - Motifs: “courage”, “belonging”, “curiosity”, etc. (picked as a set)
  - Supporting cast: mentor/sidekick/rival archetypes
  - Twist type: reveal / reversal / sacrifice / surprise ally
  - Humor intensity: low/med/high + humor style (dry/warm/showman)
  - Moral/theme emphasis (light, not preachy)

Slide 6 — Weighted Pools + Constraints (the coherence guardrails)
- Pools are weighted (not uniform) to avoid low-quality combinations
- Constraints prevent contradictions:
  - tone conflicts (e.g., “cozy bedtime” + “horror stakes” blocked)
  - character continuity constraints (hero traits must align with actions)
  - motif coherence (motif set must appear across beats/pages)
- Output includes “reasons” for picks for debuggability

Slide 7 — Seed + Replay + Selective Re-Roll (premium UX feature)
- Every run generates a seed visible to the user (or hidden in basic)
- Users can:
  - lock the entire result (“save this version”)
  - re-roll only one dimension:
    - “new twist”
    - “new setting”
    - “new sidekick personality”
    - “more/less humor”
- This makes “RNG” feel like control, not chaos

Slide 8 — Anti-Samey System (measurable uniqueness)
- Similarity heuristics computed on key fields:
  - logline overlap
  - beat map overlap
  - motif set overlap
  - twist-type repetition
  - prompt descriptor repetition (visual sameness)
- “Diversity budget” rules:
  - do not repeat same twist type within N runs
  - motif set must differ by at least K elements
  - side character archetype rotation

Slide 9 — Where it plugs into the pipeline (stations)
- Variation Engine runs at multiple “decision stations”:
  - Story Blueprint (beat map + twist + motif set)
  - Manuscript Draft (voice + pacing + humor)
  - Illustration Prompts (style bible + per-page prompt specificity)
- Output is always stored in state:
  - seed
  - knob profile
  - selected directives
  - diversity metrics

Slide 10 — MVP vs Premium (how it scales)
- Basic Mode:
  - smaller knob surface (curated)
  - fewer re-roll options (maybe 1)
  - still uses engine under hood for quality
- Premium Creator Mode:
  - more knobs, deeper intent capture
  - selective re-roll controls
  - “Uniqueness meter” + variation history

Slide 11 — Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: complexity creep
  - Mitigation: directives are limited set + staged rollout (Blueprint first)
- Risk: variation breaks continuity
  - Mitigation: constraints + validation gates per station
- Risk: “uniqueness metrics” feel arbitrary
  - Mitigation: keep it dev-facing first; only surface to users if it helps

Slide 12 — Success Criteria
- Generate 50 books from similar inputs with low “samey” flags
- Users can re-roll one dimension without losing the rest
- Variation stays coherent (no contradictions across beats/pages/prompts)
- Premium output feels “custom made,” not “template”

Slide 13 — Next Steps (implementation order)
1) Define Variation Directive schema + seed handling
2) Add knob profiles + weighted pools + constraints
3) Integrate into Story Blueprint (first integration point)
4) Add dev-only RNG Sweep harness (via Golden Path Simulator)
5) Expand integration into Manuscript Draft + Prompt generation
6) Add selective re-roll UX (Premium)
