PRESENTATION PACKAGE #5 — “Artifact Wall” (Progress You Can See, Keep, and Share)

Slide 1 — Title
- Artifact Wall: a persistent proof-of-work dashboard across the entire journey
- Goal: make progress feel real and premium, not just “chat steps”
- Outcome: higher completion, higher confidence, better shareability

Slide 2 — The Problem
- Users can’t “see” what they’ve earned until the very end
- The journey can feel like a form: answer → next → answer → next
- When something fails, users worry they lost everything
- Result: drop-offs, lower perceived value, and “it felt like work”

Slide 3 — The Proposal
- A persistent “Artifact Wall” panel that shows:
  - unlocked artifacts per act/station
  - previews and quick exports
  - progress passport / checklist
  - version history (especially for RNG rerolls)
- It’s always available, but never distracts from the main flow

Slide 4 — What counts as an Artifact
- Examples (mapped to your journey):
  - Hero Card (identity + portrait + traits)
  - Style Bible / Visual Consistency Tag sheet
  - Story Blueprint (beats + themes + page plan)
  - Draft Pages Preview (text excerpts)
  - Prompt Pack Snapshot (illustration prompts per page)
  - Illustration Gallery (thumbs)
  - Final Book Pack (PDF/HTML/JSON bundle)
  - Certificate / Credits page (ceremonial completion)

Slide 5 — How it feels (premium accomplishment)
- Each act ends with an achievement landing page
- Artifact Wall becomes the “trophy case”
- The user can:
  - revisit, tweak, reroll a dimension
  - export/share artifacts incrementally
- This creates momentum: “I’m building something tangible”

Slide 6 — UX Layout (simple, scalable)
- Desktop:
  - main stage on left
  - Artifact Wall on right (collapsible)
- Mobile:
  - Artifact Wall becomes a “drawer” or bottom sheet
- Each artifact card shows:
  - name, badge, short description
  - preview (image/text)
  - actions: View / Download / Copy / Reuse

Slide 7 — Versioning + RNG History (solves samey + control)
- When Variation Engine produces a new seed/run:
  - add a “Version chip” to relevant artifacts
- Users can:
  - compare versions (A/B)
  - revert
  - lock a version before proceeding
- This turns RNG into a premium creative tool

Slide 8 — Reliability + Recovery (confidence layer)
- Artifact Wall doubles as a safety net:
  - last good snapshot visible
  - “Restore last checkpoint” (dev and user-friendly)
- Reduces fear: “If something breaks, I won’t lose my progress”

Slide 9 — Monetization alignment (why it supports revenue)
- Basic Mode:
  - fewer artifacts, fewer exports
  - still shows progress (value)
- Premium:
  - more artifacts (gallery, HTML pack, market upload pack)
  - version compare + selective rerolls
  - “Share Pack” assets formatted for social
- Users see “what they gain” immediately, not as a hidden promise

Slide 10 — Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: UI clutter
  - Mitigation: collapsible, progressive reveal, only show unlocked artifacts
- Risk: artifact explosion (too many cards)
  - Mitigation: group by act, collapse sections, search/filter
- Risk: exports become messy
  - Mitigation: standardized export buttons + clear naming conventions

Slide 11 — Success Criteria
- Users can always answer: “What have I built so far?”
- Completion rate improves (less drop-off mid-flow)
- Users export/share intermediate artifacts (increased virality)
- Reduced support questions about “where is my output?”

Slide 12 — Next Steps (implementation order)
1) Define artifact schema (type, title, preview, actions, source state paths)
2) Add minimal Artifact Wall UI (collapsible)
3) Wire in first artifacts: Hero Card + Blueprint + Progress Passport
4) Add snapshot/version chips for rerolls
5) Expand to gallery + final pack + certificate
