PRESENTATION PACKAGE #3 — “Station System” (Nuance by Design, Not Memory)

Slide 1 — Title
- Station System: turn StorySmith into a guided ride with explicit checkpoints
- Goal: stop skipping nuance by making every micro-step a first-class station
- Outcome: faster iteration, clearer UX, easier premium expansion

Slide 2 — The Problem
- Too much gets “crammed” into a single act/screen → missing obvious steps
- UX nuance depends on humans remembering what to ask/confirm
- Adding depth (Premium Creator Mode) becomes chaotic without structure
- Result: the framework works, but the experience feels thin or technical

Slide 3 — The Proposal
- Represent the user journey as a graph of Acts and Stations (micro-steps)
- The UI becomes a renderer of the station config
- Each station has:
  - purpose, inputs required, output produced, persona/tone, next rules
- Achievements become station endpoints (automatic “landing pages”)

Slide 4 — Definitions (simple mental model)
- Act = a chapter of the ride (macro phase)
- Station = a single interaction checkpoint (micro step)
- Artifact = tangible output earned at certain stations
- Gate = validation before allowing progression

Slide 5 — What this unlocks (the leap)
- “100 steps” without “100 acts”
- Every nuance is explicit: no guessing what’s missing
- Consistent UX: each station knows what to show, ask, and confirm
- Premium depth becomes additive (more stations), not disruptive refactors

Slide 6 — Station Metadata (the contract)
- Station fields (conceptually):
  - id, actId, title, description
  - persona mode + humor intensity + ceremony mode flag
  - inputsNeeded (fields or prior artifacts)
  - outputsProduced (fields/artifacts)
  - actions (API calls, local transforms, prompt generation)
  - next (rules: conditional branching, optional stations, skip rules)
  - validations (invariants + required fields)
  - recovery (retry behavior + user-friendly error copy)

Slide 7 — Mapping to your existing system
- Keep the existing components/acts, but wrap them in station flow:
  - ForgeHero becomes Act II stations
  - SpinTale becomes Act III stations
  - BindBook becomes Acts IV–VI stations
- You don’t rewrite everything at once:
  - Start by adding station config + a “Station Navigator”
  - Gradually move logic to station actions over time

Slide 8 — Premium Creator Mode becomes a station pack
- Basic Mode:
  - fewer stations, curated choices, faster completion
- Premium Creator Mode:
  - additional station packs enabled:
    - deeper intent capture
    - selective reroll controls
    - market-ready metadata
- Same engine, different station set

Slide 9 — Achievement Landing Pages become standardized
- Every act ends with a station of type: “Achievement”
- Achievement station spec includes:
  - artifact reveal
  - badge name + premium copy
  - next CTA
- Guarantees “double the acts” feeling without multiplying complexity

Slide 10 — UX Testing becomes systematic
- Every station can have:
  - expected time-to-complete
  - drop-off risk rating
  - “wow moment” tag
- You can audit the journey like a storyboard:
  - Where are the wow beats?
  - Where is it too form-like?
  - Where does it need humor or ceremony?

Slide 11 — Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: too abstract / over-engineering
  - Mitigation: incremental rollout; keep config minimal at first
- Risk: slows shipping short-term
  - Mitigation: start with “navigator + config overlays” rather than rewrites
- Risk: branching complexity
  - Mitigation: keep branching rare; use station packs for depth instead

Slide 12 — Success Criteria
- We can add 10 new micro-steps without touching 10 different components
- UX audits identify missing nuance instantly (no hidden assumptions)
- Premium Creator Mode adds depth via station packs without destabilizing base
- Drop-offs decrease; perceived “fun + accomplishment” increases

Slide 13 — Next Steps (implementation order)
1) Define station schema + minimal config file
2) Build a Station Navigator (dev-only first)
3) Map current flow into stations (no behavior changes)
4) Add validation gates + achievement stations
5) Add premium station pack toggles
6) Expand: integrate Variation Engine directives per station
