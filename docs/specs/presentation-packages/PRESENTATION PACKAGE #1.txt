PRESENTATION PACKAGE #1 — “Golden Path Simulator” (Dev-Only)

Slide 1 — Title
- Golden Path Simulator: the fastest way to ship better UX + higher variation
- Dev-only tool to iterate StorySmith without replaying Acts manually
- Outcome: more nuance, less rework, measurable RNG diversity

Slide 2 — The Problem (what’s slowing us down)
- We spend too much time re-running early acts just to test later stages
- UX nuance is hard to validate because iterations are slow and inconsistent
- RNG/variation is “felt” but not measured, so “samey outputs” slip through
- Result: engineering progresses, but experience quality lags behind

Slide 3 — The Proposal (what we’re building)
- A dev-only page/route inside StorySmith that can:
  1) Load canonical fixture bundles (Part1/Part2/Final)
  2) Jump to any act/station instantly
  3) Run one-click end-to-end “Golden Path”
  4) Run “RNG Sweep” N times + compute similarity flags (“anti-samey”)
  5) Export results to JSON for review/regression tracking

Slide 4 — Why this matters (the leverage)
- Converts iteration from “hours per test” → “minutes per test”
- Makes UX nuance testable: every station can be revisited instantly
- Makes RNG measurable: diversity becomes a dashboard, not a vibe
- Reduces wasted cycles: fewer “we built it but didn’t feel it” loops

Slide 5 — What it looks like (UI sketch in words)
- Fixture Panel:
  - Select Fixture: Part1 / Part2 / Final
  - Load → inject into StoryState + navigate to chosen act/station
- Jump Panel:
  - Act selector + Station selector + Jump button
- Golden Path Panel:
  - Run Golden Path → progress + timing per stage + errors
- RNG Sweep Panel:
  - N (default 10), seed mode, knob preset
  - Run Sweep → table of runs + similarity scores + flagged “samey” rows
  - Download JSON (runs + metrics)

Slide 6 — RNG Sweep + Similarity (anti-samey, lightweight)
- “RNG” definition: structured variation without breaking continuity
- Per-run tracked fields:
  - seed, knobs, logline, scene beats, excerpted page drafts, prompt excerpts, timings, errors
- Similarity heuristics (no heavy deps):
  - token overlap (Jaccard) on loglines/beats/excerpts
  - n-gram overlap on key text fields (optional)
- Dashboard outputs:
  - min/avg/max similarity
  - count flagged above threshold
  - which knobs correlate with higher diversity

Slide 7 — Scope & Safety (dev-only, no production risk)
- Must be inaccessible in prod:
  - gate: NODE_ENV !== "production" AND STORYSMITH_DEVTOOLS=1
- No secrets; no market upload actions
- Minimal dependencies; reuse existing state/hooks/routes

Slide 8 — Deliverables (what we ship)
- Dev-only route (e.g., /dev/simulator)
- 3 canonical fixtures stored safely and loadable in browser
- Golden Path runner (uses existing APIs; fixture bypass allowed)
- RNG Sweep runner + similarity scoring + JSON export
- Short docs: “How to use simulator” + “How to regenerate fixtures”

Slide 9 — Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: contaminating normal UX/state flows
  - Mitigation: isolated route, explicit state reset, feature-flag gating
- Risk: fixtures drift from reality
  - Mitigation: documented regen steps + “fixture version” metadata
- Risk: similarity metrics misleading
  - Mitigation: treat as heuristic; tune thresholds; focus on trend + flags

Slide 10 — Success Criteria (how we know it worked)
- Can jump to any act/station in <10 seconds
- Can run Golden Path end-to-end without manual setup
- RNG Sweep produces visible diversity metrics and flags samey runs
- Team uses simulator as default loop for UX/RNG iteration for 1 week

Slide 11 — Next Steps (execution order)
1) Add dev-only route + gating
2) Add fixture loading (Part1/Part2/Final)
3) Implement Jump-to-Act/Station mapping
4) Implement Golden Path runner + progress + timings
5) Implement RNG Sweep + similarity scoring + JSON export
6) Add usage docs + fixture regen notes
