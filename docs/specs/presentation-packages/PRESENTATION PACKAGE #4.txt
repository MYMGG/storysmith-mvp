PRESENTATION PACKAGE #4 — “Tone Choreography Layer” (Consistent Fun, Earned Pride)

Slide 1 — Title
- Tone Choreography: make StorySmith feel like a premium guided attraction
- Goal: fun + witty + entertaining, while still mature and fulfilling
- Outcome: consistent voice across stations, less “AI-ish” output, higher trust

Slide 2 — The Problem
- Tone drifts between screens/acts (showman vs technician vs generic AI)
- “Fun” risks becoming juvenile or gimmicky without rules
- The same copy patterns repeat (“Great! Now…”), reducing delight
- Result: users finish the flow but don’t feel that premium accomplishment

Slide 3 — The Proposal
- A centralized Tone Controller that sets voice by Act/Station:
  - humor intensity
  - formality
  - ceremony mode
  - pacing style (short/medium/epic)
- Stations request a tone profile; copy/prompt generation follows it

Slide 4 — What “Tone” means (components)
- Personality: showman / craftsman / ceremonial
- Humor style: dry wit vs warm playful vs big showman
- Confidence: calm competence (premium) rather than hype
- Clarity: zero technical jargon, but not childish
- Emotional cadence: curiosity → anticipation → pride

Slide 5 — Tone Profiles (by journey phase)
- Welcome (Act I): “Inviting Showman”
  - short lines, playful prompts, fast momentum
- Crafting (mid-acts): “Confident Craftsman”
  - purposeful, focused, subtly witty, avoids fluff
- Reveal (act ends): “Ceremonial Premium Pride”
  - dignified, emotionally resonant, accomplishment-focused
- Recovery moments: “Calm Guide”
  - non-blaming language, clear next steps

Slide 6 — Guardrails (avoiding gimmick)
- Banned tone pitfalls:
  - baby talk
  - excessive exclamation points
  - “as an AI…”
  - empty praise (“Amazing!” every step)
- Approved patterns:
  - “earned praise” (tied to what the user actually chose)
  - “craft language” (atelier, workshop, proof-of-work)
  - “ceremony language” (unveiling, credits, signature)

Slide 7 — Microcopy System (repeatable, not repetitive)
- Build a small library of reusable microcopy atoms:
  - transitions (“Next station” lines)
  - confirmations (what you heard + why it matters)
  - prompts (multiple-choice intros)
  - celebratory lines (earned + specific)
  - recovery prompts (retry + preserve progress)
- Each atom has 3–5 variants to avoid repetition fatigue

Slide 8 — Persona Choreography (multiple personas over time)
- Today: 3 personas aligned to major phases
- Future: seasonal persona packs (monthly themes)
- Tone Controller enables swapping persona skins without rewriting flows:
  - station asks for “showman-witty-2” not “WizardRainbowHat”
- Supports your “theme park attraction” vision as a system, not lore

Slide 9 — Where it plugs in
- Station System requests a tone profile per station
- Variation Engine can adjust tone knobs safely (“more dry”, “less silly”)
- Achievement landing pages pull from ceremony profile
- Error recovery uses “Calm Guide” profile

Slide 10 — Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: adds complexity without measurable value
  - Mitigation: tie success criteria to retention/completion and user feedback
- Risk: tone feels forced or formulaic
  - Mitigation: atom variants + station-specific callbacks to user choices
- Risk: seasonal personas break consistency
  - Mitigation: persona skins map to the same underlying tone profiles

Slide 11 — Success Criteria
- Output and microcopy feel consistent across the whole ride
- Users report “fun” + “premium” simultaneously (not childish)
- Reduction in “AI-ish” phrasing and repetitive transitions
- Achievement pages create a felt sense of accomplishment

Slide 12 — Next Steps (implementation order)
1) Define tone profiles and banned/approved phrase rules
2) Build microcopy atom library with variants
3) Tag stations with tone profile + humor intensity
4) Apply ceremony mode to all act-end achievement screens
5) Add seasonal persona skin support (post-MVP)
